# Lake Altimetry Toolbox

This repository provides a Python toolbox for downloading, extracting, and visualizing global lake water level time series using the [G-REALM database](https://ipad.fas.usda.gov/cropexplorer/global_reservoir/), derived from satellite radar altimetry.

## Overview

This toolbox supports the workflow for research projects on global lake water level changes.

It includes two main Python scripts:
- **Download GREAL** – A script for interactive downloading and extracting G-REALM data files.
- **Toolbox** – Scripts for parsing, structuring, and plotting lake altimetry time series.

All scripts are ready for use with the G-REALM public dataset maintained by USDA-FAS, NASA, CNES, ESA, and partners.
